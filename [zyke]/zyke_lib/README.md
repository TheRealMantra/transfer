# What Is This?

Our library acts as a bridge for dependencies, such as frameworks, progressbars, dispatch systems, inventories etc. Our resources call functions within the library, which then calls the automatically selected dependency to streamline the entire process. Despite it's name, it is not the same as other libraries such as ox_lib.

There are a few similar resources from other creators, but unfortunately no centralized solution that everyone can use exists. This is because these libraries are usually constructed differently, consume and return different information etc.

All of our resources are built on top of this library, and is a requirement to use if you wish to run any of them.

## Important

Downloading an experimental & non-release version is **not recommended unless you know what you are doing**. We constantly update this repository to make the development of Zyke Resources' scripts easier, and we don't always test all functionality on different servers using different frameworks. **Head over to the release page for a stable release.**

## Modified Servers

Please be aware that heavily modified servers may cause our library to struggle without any adapting. Everything framework-dependant in our resources can be modified in our library, or in the unlocked files of the resource. If you are unsure if our resources will work for you, feel free to create a ticket in our Discord and we will assist you swiftly.
