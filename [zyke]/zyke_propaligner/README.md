# Information

This is an easy-to-use solution to your prop alignment hell. With our sleek UI you can utilize inputs, history & presets to speed up your alignment for your props.

The entire project is the first effort to make a great alignment menu, and more updates to streamline the process will come in the future once I am available to work on it.
